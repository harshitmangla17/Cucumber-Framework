# Cucumber-Framework
I developed this framework for Login functionality of "https://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/login"(A demo website) using Cucumber.
In this login.feature file acts as a blueprint for what to implement.
I implemented this feature file using Steps,TestRun,LoginPage java files and also used POM(Page Object Model) in implementation.
